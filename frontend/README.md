# ModernMimic

This is the web-based, fully javascript Modern Mimic display for EHMRS.

## Building
The system is written in JavaScript and CSS, and built using Laravel Mix

To kick off a build, first install the node dependancies: `npm install`

Once those have been installed, run `npx mix --production`. This creates a
minified build of the system. Files will be created in the dist folder.
